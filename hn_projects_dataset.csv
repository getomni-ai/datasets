Syllabics are specially adapted for Inuktitut and well-loved by the Inuit, but unfortunately can be a pain to input on a computer, so often times the more cumbersome latin alphabet is used in casual writing.Tom Scott has an awesome video about how syllabics work[1], but breifly, the shape of the character determined its inital consonant spund, and the rotation determines its vowel sound. So ᐱ = pi, ᐳ = pu, ᐸ = pa, ᑎ = ti, ᑐ = tu, ᑕ = ta, etc. The word ""Inuktitut"" becomes ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ in syllabics.Transliterating between the two is fairly simple, but there are edge-cases around dialects and whatnot. The more interesting problem from a technical perspective is having a web extension that can detect Inuktitut on a web page (in wither writing system), and transliterate that into whatever writing system the user desires, whilst never accidentally transliterating the other text on the page (""inhabitants"" could be picked up and transliterated as ""ᐃᓐᕼᐊᖯᐃᑕᓐᑦᔅ"", for example, even though that makes no sense).The project is mostly using Rust via WebAssembly, which has been a lot of fun to work with and has let me do some awesome things, like avoiding heap allocation and using compile-time hashmaps to do conversions on the text. The build system has to do a lot and I eventually settled on python. Right now I'm trying to wrangle JS and the DOM (there's a lot of edge cases to deal with), and that's been difficult as it's not my wheelhouse.1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW4hI_METac&t=15s","[]","0","49","PERSONAL_PROJECT",false,,"SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT","Creating a Web Extension for Inuktitut Language Transliteration","[Rust, WebAssembly, Python, JavaScript, DOM]",,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW4hI_METac&amp;t=15s",false

It cuts down integration time from +6 months to less than a day, and handles many Stripe API pitfalls.Stripe has a ""developer friendly"" and ""easy to use"" reputation. But, since 2019 the EU regulation has stepped in and made things more complex with 2nd factor authentication for payments (3DS/SCA). This made payment integrations way more complex. Integrating Stripe subscriptions now easily takes 6 man-months (I'm being very optimistic here).Also, there are some basic scenarios that are hard to get right:- Creating a paid subscription and ensure a customer always has a card on file (this one is almost impossible).
- Upgrading a free ($0) plan to a paid one.
- Upgrading paid plans, eg $10 to $100/month and ensuring immediate payment.
- Guarantee customer Tax location, keep the flow simple.I made a video analyzing Stripe integration of a successful SaaS company (+$100M valuation).

With emphasis on simplicity, speed, and function inspired by Linux Mint MATE.It has been a wild ride. Often frustrating but rewarding. Some days I may spend 10 hours solving an API for which app is frontmost at a given second. Sure, there's a system API for that, but it doesn't even remotely cover edge cases that exist. And many times with no answers out there on how to do something, it feels like I'm the first, so finally solving it is a great endorphin rush.Part of the complexity is I wanted the app to be completely pluggable, kind of like Obsidian. The app communicates events to a local socket server in full duplex, which enables cross-plugin communication (but also cross-app!). Plugins access the app's JavaScript system bridge API for pubsub and system calls through a Webkit interface. Edits are hot reloaded and instant, no compile time necessary. The first time I could change my ""Start"" menu in real time through JavaScript/CSS was quite a feeling.Sadly, I couldn't leverage existing tools like Tauri or Electron. They don't have adequate system bridge APIs available, and would be more work to leverage instead of less. They are too general, whereas this project only builds to macos. Therefore it can be much more complicated (and useful) by design.I originally set out to be more productive in macos. But I've also spent time making prototypes for fun. A desktop widget system, real-time system color theme set from Spotify album art, live video desktop backgrounds from Twitch/YT, a Destiny 2 macos system theme, etc.I plan to open source it and build a community around it one day.","[{""commentText"":""I haven't used MacOS in years and have been forced to use Windows for work.

Your neural pathways form around a certain way of work management and it becomes hard to change that after ten years.I'm naturally biased then to early Windows and MATE-esque environments. And, it's worth noting that I despise Win11 overall, so a better comparison is indeed Linux Mint MATE[1]. Part of the project inspiration is to never use Windows 11 again, actually!Before I started the project I wrote down what I consider productivity boosters for me:1. Fast context switching between open apps and windows, natively. All open apps are in front of me by way of the taskbar, always, and never hidden. I never have to think about where to find my immediate work. I can group apps, pin them, and create custom behavior for them.2. System tray apps for things that you interact with often, but aren't necessarily immediately working on. Macos has something similar but it isn't really pluggable or widely used yet, and nowhere near as customizable. With Win10 I can add, remove, or hide system tray apps based on how I use my workstation best.3. Optimized Start Menu. I press a button, I get access to things I've favorited, recent apps/files, and categories of apps I use often. It is highly customizable in Win10, while I struggle to have something as efficient in macos (even though macos global search is wonderful!).I feel like the old UX rule of \""don't make me think\"" applies heavily here. The macos app dock is a great example of this. You're forced to think about what you want to do with 10-20+ options glaring at you. Disabling the dock is the first thing I do on a new Mac ;)Lastly, Win10 lets me customize my system to a high degree as my needs change. I just don't get that with macos, nor have I found apps that hit the mark for me.I'm curious about your own experiences if you care to share :-)-[1] Linux Mint MATE: https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_vanessa_mate_whatsnew.php"",""commentUser"":""zschuessler"",""indent"":""2"",""children"":[]}]}]","1","109","PERSONAL_PROJECT",true,,"SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT","Porting Windows Taskbar Features to macOS with Pluggable Apps","[Linux Mint MATE, JavaScript, Webkit, CSS]","1.5",,false

I will also talk about Command-Line Interface Guidelines showing how to make powerful, useful and easy-to-use command-line application which you can use every day in your workflow.The course is still work in progress and I don't even have a web page for it. But I do have my newsletter where I share best resources about Go. By subscribing to this newsletter you will be notified once course is ready to launch. Also, everyone who's subscribed to my newsletter and will be in first batch to buy a course gets a 50% discount.So, if you are interested in this kind of stuff join the waitlist for course in my newsletter on https://kovalevsky.ioP.S. I also have daily base newsletter about Go - Daily Golang. If you subscribe to this newsletter you will also be notified once course is ready to launch you and will get 50% discount to buy the course - https://kovalevsky.io/daily-golang.","[]","0","75","PERSONAL_PROJECT",false,,"EDUCATION","Building Command Line Interfaces From Scratch In Go","[Go]",,,false

I’m building https://www.unwrangle.com to make it easier to scrape data from ecommerce and other sites that are hard to scrape.It’s like Apify but my goal is to make it easier to useCurrently, I have APIs and scrapers that work with platforms like Google Maps, Yelp and Amazon. The APIs are useful to get data immediately and scrapers to extract information from many URLs.The plan is to add more general purpose APIs like an HTML API, Markdown API and eventually features to build your own api and scrapers with AI.There’s a lot of tools in the space nowadays but imo they are all flaky. My intention with unwrangle is to offer a way to scrape any site that just works without the need for any config or complicated pricing. The project is at a little over $1000 MRR. Marketing it has been and continues to be a big challenge. I’m bootstrapping solo and hoping to reach 5-10k MRR in the following months. Plan for that is to consistently improve offering and conduct marketing experiments.What I find interesting about it: I’m offering easy ways to scrape sites on which antibot is really hard to bypass like Twitter, paywalled sites, LinkedIn, etc. The ability to build crawlers without writing any code is kinda cool. User who would normally not have used web data are scheduling scraping jobs and using the data for analysis. For the HTML API I’m thinking of doing an interesting spin on what others like ScrapingBee are doing and abstracting the needless config like premium proxy etc. and just effectively offering a higher # of requests. Also for the build your own scraper, offering users a way to create a parser with a prompt and use it in a single browser session to collect data from many pages saves hassle compared to a synchronous API approach","[]","0","555","STARTUP",false,,"SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT","Unwrangle Provides Easy Data Scraping for Challenging Websites","[]",,,false

Felt like I was paying for a product and also the product. I just needed to keep 2 calendars in sync, not smart meetings, analytics, integrations, etc. ideally I set it up and forget about it.I really needed a way to sync my calendars privately, without all the extras. Now that Dropbox has purchased Reclaim, it's even more important I feel like my calendars are not spied on. I knew I could provide a similar service.Here’s what makes me excited about it as a user:Affordable: Just $20/year with a 7-day free trial. Cancel at any time for a pro-rated refund.Privacy First: No need to store events on a servers enabling unlimited calendar syncs.Working Hours: Adaptive feature that adjusts if an event falls outside your specified working hours.Round Event Times: Opt to round event start and end times to the nearest 15 or 30 minutes for cleaner scheduling.Invitations: Block time between calendars when you receive a meeting invitation that you haven't responded to yet. Decline it? The time block on your other calendar is removed.My plan is to keep it small and focused, while also listening to user feedback for how you'd like to manage your personal and work calendars more efficiently.Thanks for checking out my new project.","[{""commentText"":""I don’t have a personal calendar and my work calendar ends at 5.

Mostly in bursts though, bc I've been juggling fleshing out the project with actually using the data. (On a related note, the current working state of the backend hasn't been pushed in a while, and still reconsidering the name.) It's mostly been an API up to this point, and most recently I've been chipping away at a frontend to accompany that, which is beginning to be useful on a personal level. In particular, I just got file upload working. But long-term, I see it as a hybrid between Tinder and a CRM (and I already have ""swipe"" animations working if not the actual touch handling), where you can bring your own data on jobs and companies -- however you get that, because I'm sure you can find better scraping processes -- and have a way of organizing them.It's a lot of experiments. On the frontend, I'm dispensing with any design systems or styling libraries, and have opted for vanilla CSS and hand-rolled animations. I'm using React for now, just to get it scaffolded faster with tools I know already, but I've been eyeing a few others, for reasons that range from a standing curiosity about Web Components to new ones about signals. The backend stack is all Deno-based: it includes Astral for any scraping needs you might have, uses Oak for routing, and leverages kvdex for storage. (I also contributed `model.getOne` and `model.updateOne` to the latter as part of initially getting duplicate detection working.) My goal is to keep the whole thing light on external dependencies, outside of a few pragmatic options, and generally work more directly with platform or runtime (or in Deno's case stdlib) functionality where feasible.I otherwise rebuilt my website over the last few months, using Lume for static site generation with similar aims about shipping something generally lighter (the content there is all Markdown, and so far, everything but the syntax highlighting and the ToC generation are built by hand). Additionally, I've been using it as a home for writing[3][4][5] and not just code, so that I have some other things I can show off.

I cannot emphasize enough how good that was (and is) for the body. The body at first doesn't like it, but giving it a bit of consistency it learns and yearns for it.The back pains I had are gone and even if they come back here and there they are much less intense and more manageable.

I think the current slapping of a chat window on software is pretty tame, if not lame. So, in addition to that chat window that replies with conversational chat, I've got over a dozen integrated into software tools LLMs that when you ask them things, their output is programmatic and either modifies the data of what you're working on, or or performs some type of modification to the software tool in use. The tools include a complete word processor, where the AI knows the word processor's API and can directly manipulate the document in the word processor, likewise for a spreadsheet, and there is a ""prompt engineer"" interface where one can clone, modify, and create new LLM Agents that have deep access to the APIs of the tools, the data in the tools, and the wider application framework.This has been in development for 3 years, and I've got an immigration law firm using it, with about 1/3rd of the LLM agents being immigration law specialist agents of some type.I'm just wrapping up transforming the system from being immigration law specific to being generic, capable of operating in any industry. I previously made a ""do it yourself: build your own home solar energy system"" as a proof of concept that this framework could be modified in such a way, which I put online for a few months and then took down, having proved what I wanted.I've got multiple creative writing 'bots: legal, technical documentation, creative writing, and code authoring. I've got multiple spreadsheet 'bots: create any standard spreadsheet form on demand, reverse engineer and explain complex spreadsheets, and co-author spreadsheets interactively with the human user, guiding them through the understanding of the spreadsheet being built. I've got foreign language translation agents that allow people without a common language to speak to one another through the voice transcription interfaces.And the users are never copying and pasting LLM outputs from one place to another, that integration is built in to the business logic of the software: ask a chatbot to write a document, the output does directly to the word processor and the document is created, likewise for spreadsheets, likewise for talking to the ""projectBot"" and asking ""what's the state of this project?"" and a detailed report is generated.I've also been making the app itself multi-lingual, and multi-skinned so it can be refaced for different cultures, demographics, and industries.

I was getting reasonable results with spiking neural networks and evolutionary training, but there are so many hyper parameters to think about and how they behave over time is really hard to predict. I was also struggling deeply with how to manage topological concerns like network growth over time.With interpreted evolutionary programs, the memory access patterns are so much more ideal with the program counter stepping through (mostly) contiguous bytes vs totally insane recurrent spiking neural access patterns. You get so many more generations & candidates evaluated per unit time that it can make previously apparent ""dead ends"" viable, simply because you don't need to have extreme patience to find out anymore. I am discovering that iteration speed is the most important thing in this arena.

The core ""default"" raymarcher is still there, but you can choose to ignore it and implement, say, volumetric rendering, while still using the provided SDF combinators if you want.The new implementation is much more general and flexible, and it now supports things like 2D extrusions, mesh export for 3D printing, user-defined procedural noise functions... anything you can do in Shadertoy, you can now do in Bauble. One upcoming feature that I'm very excited about is custom uniforms and embedding in other webpages -- so you can write a blog post with interactive 3D visualizations, for example.(Also as a fun coincidence: my first cast bronze Bauble arrived today! https://x.com/ianthehenry/status/1827461714524434883)","[{""commentText"":""Am I right that the output of the lisp code is ultimately a plain GLSL shader (like one might find on shadertoy.com)?I built a SDF-based rendering system (2D) for my game, and one of the big hurdles was how to have them be data-driven, rather than needing a new shader for each scene or object.Would be curious if/how you tackled that problem (:"",""commentUser"":""turtledragonfly"",""indent"":""1"",""children"":[{""commentText"":""I've done this for a project where the SDF functions are basically instructions, and you can build up instrictions on the CPU to send to the shader. and then the fragment shader runs them like a mini bytecode interpreter.

Firstly, we're both the type of people who often edit our Slack messages (or any other messages like WhatsApp) to correct mistakes. Secondly, my wife is a PMM at a tech company, but she can't code. I've been telling her that anyone can create a decent product with the help of LLMs and tools like Replit, but she usually just rolls her eyes. So, on a flight from London to SF, I suggested we build Spruce. The idea was that she would take the lead and rely on LLMs (ChatGPT + Ollama for when the wonderful Delta internet wasn't working), and she could also treat me as a [more intelligent] LLM. After ~12 hours and a few small arguments, Spruce was born. :)Some random learnings, top of mind:1. A non-technical person, even with current LLMs (GPT 4.5), can't go from idea to shipped product without at least some help from a technical person.2. I now make even more typos because my habit is to type as fast as possible, often without even pressing the space bar. Spruce autocorrects everything in Slack, but when I'm using other products, I feel incomplete.3. Although I'm practically a native English speaker, it's still my second language. I've added a feature to Spruce, just for myself for now, that DMs me if I make really obvious grammar/English mistakes in my messages. I decided to do this after one of my colleagues, who is very English, said ""for prosperity"" instead of ""for posterity"" in several messages, and another said ""for all intensive purposes"" instead of ""for all intents and purposes."" It's been a very cool development, at least for me! It's fun because a) it has a nice tone, and b) it's not verbose and only nudges you on major mistakes, and only up to twice a day.
Anyway, feel free to give it a try: https://spruce.so/P.S. This Slack app necessarily needs the permissions it has because it needs to be able to read and edit your messages everywhere (e.g., public channels, private channels, DMs, etc.). Don't install it if that freaks you out. However, it's easy to remove Slack apps, so there's no harm in giving it a try.","[]","0","601","STARTUP",false,,"MOBILE_APPLICATIONS","Building Spruce A Slack App For Autocorrecting Typos","[Slack, LLMs, Replit, ChatGPT, Ollama, GPT 4.5]",,"https://spruce.so/",true

I'd rather write 3 separate apps (web, ios, android) that feel great, than ship something faster (if even...) that is so bad, sometimes I feel it's a spit in the face of our customers.The mobile alternatives became much better: when they started, they were (as I remember) significantly better than the alternatives. Since then, RN became much better, Swift and Kotlin became mainstream, SwiftUI, Jetpack Computer came out, and in a couple of years KMP will also offer a pretty compelling alternative.Flutter is spread too thin: I understand why they did it, it's great for marketing, and I know people who use it on web, desktop and embedded and are happy... To me, however, it feels like they added platforms before making iOS and Android work and feel great.

Part of the goal is to more natively support byte-oriented data structures and reduce overheads.  It supports a bidirectional HTTP2-style ""channel"" concept, but without making any assumptions about how they're meant to be used.  It also can be configured to require authentication of the client and/or server, but punts secrecy to a lower-level transport protocol.  It uses Rust macros to generate traits and wrappers to make the ergonomics fairly easy.Currently I've built a call/response RPC abstraction with it to use it for another project that I'm working on.  Eventually I'd want to add a streaming message system beyond the basic call/response pattern.  I also might like to ship some easy setup to bridge between these protocol abstractions and ZMQ, JSON-RPC, be able to behave like inetd, etc.It's functional enough to use in non-production environments but not completely seriously yet.  I'm working out the kinks and improving the DX by using it for that other project.

They tended to hit very similar pitfalls and want to coerce the type system to behave like what they’re familiar with, and inevitably they wound up with inflexible and error-prone architecture.They also failed to accomplish any kind of holistic, 30,000ft view architecture because implementations were too often sent off the rails by not understanding the language deeply enough. That was often in part due to type system confusion inherent to how Go implements certain data structures (particularly slices), which leads to the sprawling repetitive Go code people dislike so much.I did all of this too, so I feel like my insight and experience would be valuable to share. I actually wrote 90% of it last year and felt like a goof, like, ahhh what am I doing obviously everyone else figured out Go faster than I did and this writing is just telling people how incompetent I am. Haha. But then I worked on another project and the situation was exactly the same. I actually used my draft content to help the team understand how I see the problem, and how to get past the mental traps that they were in.Fundamentally it comes down to “learn the type system/language properly”, but it’s not quite so blatant or unhelpful. One of the problems with TypeScript methodologies is that they’re so ridiculously flexible, but go is not at all in the same ways, yet they have just enough superficially in common to trick you into thinking otherwise.So, my series essentially elucidates the similarities, differences, and what’s totally absent in Go from the bottom to the top. It’s interesting because they really are remarkably similar in some ways, which is precisely why it can trip newcomers up. Knowing why that’s a trap makes you a far, far better Go developer. Along the way it also reveals details about TypeScript that some people might not be fully aware of (at least several in the team I shared the drafts with said so), which could be helpful.I mostly need to muster the courage to hit publish now. My confidence has taken a beating in the last year or so!","[]","0","227","PERSONAL_PROJECT",false,,"SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT","Navigating Golang for Experienced TypeScript Developers: Pitfalls and Insights","[Go, TypeScript]",,,false

This is due to a combination of the advent of semantic search and the revival of personal knowledge management in the deluge of our age.As such, I’ve been working on the software to bring this vision to life, which is called Your Commonbase (a portmanteau of Commonplace Book and Vector Database).In short, the purpose of the work is to create a data structure that works the way humans store, retrieve, and share information. By making these three elements as close to zero stress as possible, you catalyze creativity through remixing and augmentation of memories. My hypothesis is a lifetime building a Commonbase creates an idiosyncratic system, filled with the interpretations of an individual or a group. This individualized structure then creates demand that others want. I.e, a curation of all of the books you have read, organized by the marginalia you have added to them. This is a system people would pay for, and also a system that becomes more valuable over time.I’ve been “working in public” by posting updates on my site [2], and am just beginning a small waitlist alpha testing phase (email me if you want in!)[1] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40192359[2] - https://www.bramadams.dev/","[{""commentText"":""This sounds interesting, but I do not totally understand your description.

The simulation runs 24/7, like a Tamagotchi, but a bit more complex, like a simplified RimWorld or Dwarf Fortress.

For a while I was just adding whatever popped into my head, as a means of learning Rust, and I naively thought the full idea would crystallize with time, but it hasn't. So, I'm trying to take a step back and figure out how to actually make a coherent game that does justice to the mechanics I want to see in my simulation. I've spent a lot of time thinking rather than coding, but I'm optimistic that I'll get through this phase sooner or later. I will admit, though, that trying to take a novel approach with game design is overwhelming at times. That's okay, though!

This allows you to quickly run file queries, and these queries can then be saved or even added as folders in the file system. When you open the folder, it automatically fills with the contents from the query. I have also created a service with LLM/AI that translates plain text into Everything's query language. This enables you to build very complex queries directly from plain text. For example, you can ask if any directories contain a certain file, and if this file is found and contains specific text, it will be displayed. You can learn more about the project at: https://thefile.ninja or watch https://youtu.be/JREufgkf5pk.

The script will function like `wg-quick`, parsing a wireguard config file and handilng the routing stuff behind the scenes, and returning a cleaned up config to be passed to `wg`.Ideally, the wireguard configs could be generated by some other tool or service, like https://wirehub.org, and automatically fetched and applied to the running wg interface.So, a one liner on a server with a public IP and the services exposed by your wireguard peers can be accessed via a custom domain name while still respecting internal wireguard routing rules (based on AllowedIPs).If anyone finds this interesting and wants to chat about it, I would love to!
